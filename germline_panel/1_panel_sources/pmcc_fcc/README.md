* annotated spreadsheet of genes personally communicated: `https://umccr.slack.com/archives/C03L56UFD/p1722387369994289`
* manually converted the `All genes` sheet to TSV (`Germline_gene_list_Updated_Jul_2024.tsv`) after download XLSX
* additionally retrieve the FCC Reqest Form `https://www.petermac.org/component/edocman/mp-mf-dm-pmcc-familial-cancer-predisposition-test-request-form/viewdocument/1016` for further provenance

Entries in this spreadsheet match genes present in the FCC Request Form ('Gene Panels' and 'Single Gene(s)' sections):
Note that the FCC Request Form includes an entry 'GREM1 (SCG5)' presumably since these are often involved in tandem
duplication, and this entry is split into individual genes for our purposes.
